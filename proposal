Project Proposal
Reinforcement Deep Learning in flappy bird
Group members: Chunlin Feng & Ting Ying


We have learned Q Learning in the class and it seems that Q Learning algorithm can be very helpful in playing game. We decide to train an agent to play Flappy Bird. First we will extract information from frame with opencv and then train the agent with Q Learning algorithm.
